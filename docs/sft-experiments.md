# SFT experiment log

One entry per training run, newest last. For how the data and training work, see [sft-dataset.md](sft-dataset.md).

**Metrics** (per field, from `training/modal_train.py`, greedy decoding constrained to the action's JSON schema, as Ollama does at run time):

- **fabricated**: the label is blank but the model filled it in. The failure fine-tuning is for, so the number to watch.
- **missed**: the label has a value but the model left it blank.
- **wrong**: both have a value and they differ.
- **exact**: every field in the record matches.

Val is for choosing settings. Test is read once per candidate model. Both are AI-written, so treat differences of a few points as noise (98 records each).

## Setup shared by all runs

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Base model | `LiquidAI/LFM2.5-230M` |
| Data | 645 approved rows, all reviewed by Claude and approved in bulk (commit `e56efb1`); split 449 train / 98 val / 98 test, stratified by group |
| Hardware | Modal, L4 GPU, account `felixglush`, env `main` |
| Tooling | Modal client 1.6.2; `transformers`, `trl`, `peft` unpinned (latest at image build); `xgrammar` for constrained decoding |
| Scoring script | `training/modal_train.py` at `2ce8a47` |

## Baseline: untouched base model

Date: 2026-10-16. Stage: `modal run training/modal_train.py --stage baseline`.

| Split | Records | Exact | Fabricated | Missed | Wrong | Bad JSON |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| val | 98 | 23.5% | 89.1% | 1.7% | 7.8% | 1 |
| test | 98 | 30.6% | 85.2% | 0.8% | 4.9% | 1 |

Reading: the base model fills in almost every field that should be blank (invented emails like `alex@example.com`, dates like `2023-10-05`). It rarely misses a stated value.

Notes on how this number was reached (so it isn't repeated):

- A first baseline without schema-constrained decoding scored 0% exact and 98/98 invalid JSON on both splits, because the base model chats back ("Sure! Here's the translated text…", "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that."). That measured the missing output constraint, not the model. Discarded.
- `lm-format-enforcer` 0.11.3 fails to import under transformers 5 (`PreTrainedTokenizerBase` moved), so scoring uses `xgrammar`.

## Run 1: LoRA, first settings

Date: 2026-10-16. Command: `modal run training/modal_train.py`.

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| LoRA | rank 16, alpha 32, dropout 0.05 |
| Targets | `q_proj k_proj v_proj out_proj in_proj w1 w2 w3` |
| Training | learning rate 2e-4, cosine, warmup 5% of steps, 3 epochs, batch 16, max length 512, best epoch by validation loss |
| Loss | on the assistant answer only (prompt/completion form) |

Result (run on Modal, app `ap-oEu0eZ5MdhP4ltHhCGbo6V`; best epoch was the last, validation loss 0.019, 0.0105, 0.0100):

| Split | Exact | Fabricated | Missed | Wrong | Bad JSON |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| val | 95.9% | 0.8% (1 of 128 blank) | 0.0% | 2.6% (3 of 116 stated) | 0 |
| test | 95.9% | 1.6% (2 of 122 blank) | 1.6% (2 of 122 stated) | 0.0% | 0 |

Against the baseline, fabrication fell from 89.1% / 85.2% to 0.8% / 1.6% and exact match rose from 23.5% / 30.6% to 95.9% on both splits. A GGUF (Q8_0, 244 MB) was exported to the `jev-sft` volume; not yet fetched or tried in Ollama.

Errors (7 records in all, read from `training/out/tuned.json`):

- **Spelled-out numbers (val, 2 of 3 wrong):** `two hundred and fifty dollars` became 150 and 450. Only a handful of spelled-out amounts above 100 are in train.
- **Truncated name (val):** `Fortis BC` became `Fortis`.
- **Name derived from an email (test):** `nanny.jo@gmail.com` gave `name: nanny.jo`. This breaks labeling rule 2.
- **Past event used as a date (test):** `dinner last night` gave `date: last night`. This breaks labeling rule 5.
- **Dropped name (test):** `jordan` in lowercase was left blank.
- **Dropped date (test):** `send it today` left `date` blank.
- **Cancellation date (val):** `I was charged by Hulu after I cancelled on October 20` kept `October 20`, which is the cancellation date, not the charge date.

Caveats, so the number is not over-read:

- Val and test are 98 records each, AI-written, and many train rows are paraphrases of the same templates, so test is likely easier than real messages. One record is about 1 point.
- The best epoch was picked on val loss, so val is slightly optimistic. Test is the cleaner number.
- Read test only once per candidate model; this run's test numbers are now spent on Run 1.

## Ideas to try next

- More data: train is 449 rows against a target of about 2,000; several fields have under 20 stated examples (`setup_autodeposit.phone` 9, `transfer_between_accounts.date` 11, `pay_bill.date` 12).
- Real user messages for val and test, so scores aren't measured on AI-written text.
- Learning rate, epochs and LoRA rank sweeps, choosing on val only.
- Add train rows for the error patterns above: spelled-out amounts over 100, multi-word company names, an email given without a name, past-event dates, lowercase names.
- Fetch the GGUF, run it in Ollama through the real extractor (`extract:eval`) and compare with the Modal numbers.
- Install `causal_conv1d` in the training image for faster convolution layers.
